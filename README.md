# EnergyResourceConsumptionUSA
This visualization is about average Energy resource consumption in USA for years 2018-2020. 
Tools: Tabaleau, Python pandas

Goal:
The purpose of this data visualization is to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected US energy consumption trends, particularly considering state-by-state population trends and the pandemic's chronology. 
The visualization tries to identify patterns in the use of various energy sources, including nuclear, natural gas, renewable energy, electricity, coal and petroleum, as well as how these patterns have evolved over time

Dataset: 
Energy Consumption and Production data State wise in United States : https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/ 
Population Data, State wise in United states : https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/ 

Main Quesions:
1. What were the US state-by-state trends of energy use before and after COVID-19? 
2. How has the use of various energy resources, including nuclear, natural gas, renewable energy, and petroleum, altered before and after COVID-19? 
3. Do states with larger and lower populations exhibit any appreciable disparities in the patterns of their energy consumption?
